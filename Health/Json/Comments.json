I imagine the methanol content of scotch is higher than for wine because scotch is distilled, concentrating both the ethanol and the methanol.

Second, ethanol metabolism inhibits methanol metabolism (and is used as an antidote), making the methanol in these beverages less toxic.",

These huge differences are not due to more frequent hand washing, the research shows that you only get a modest reduction by taking such measures to avoid exposure to the cold virus.",
